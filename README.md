## Aweful Falafel Waffle 

To put it simply --> https://github.com/OrganicCoder/wordrunner/edit/master/README.md 

- We're prototyping a side scroller game. 
- The character runs and jumps on it's own (for now).
- To attack (or get around - #euphemisms) the obstacle, you have to use your words.
- Scratch that...
- You have to use the words that we present to you at the beginning of the game.
- The score is based on the number of attempts it takes to get around an obstacle.
- You will get a hint if you don't get the word correctly... 
- Hint: It'll be displayed on the input bar!

Your valuable feedback is... valuable. 

### Start The Game

Type start to start.


### Words Scene

- The words displayed here will be the words you use on the obstacles. 
- One word per obstacle. 
- For example: you can use "oil" (the attack) on "fire" (the obstacle). Just kidding, don't use oil. 

### THE Scene

- The character will run and jump.
- Once the character approaches an obstacle, slow-mo mode will be activated, and that'll be your cue to guess which word to use on the given obstacle. 

### The Byes

After the character has gone through all the scenes, your final score will be presented.
- As of now, there are 5 scenes to complete.
- Expansion pack will take place post prototype phase!
